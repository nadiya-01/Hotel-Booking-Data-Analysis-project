Data Analysis Report: Hotel Booking Trends

Introduction:
This report presents a comprehensive data analysis conducted on a hotel booking dataset to explore various trends and patterns related to hotel reservations, cancellations, and average daily rates (ADR). The dataset was analyzed using Python programming language and popular data manipulation and visualization libraries, including Pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Key Findings:

Reservation Status and Cancellation Trends:

The dataset consists of 119,390 hotel bookings, of which 62.87% were not cancelled, and 37.13% were cancelled.
The City Hotel had a higher number of reservations compared to the Resort Hotel, with 79,330 and 40,060 bookings, respectively. However, the City Hotel also experienced a higher cancellation rate (41.71%) than the Resort Hotel (27.98%).
Average Daily Rate (ADR) Analysis:

The ADR was higher in the Resort Hotel compared to the City Hotel, indicating that the Resort Hotel generally had higher room rates.
ADR showed seasonal variations, with the highest rates observed in January and August. Notably, cancellations were also more prevalent during these peak ADR months, suggesting a correlation between higher prices and increased cancellations.
Monthly Reservation and Cancellation Patterns:

The analysis of monthly reservation patterns revealed that August and July were the months with the highest number of bookings, followed by May and October. Conversely, November and January had the lowest reservation counts.
The same monthly trend was observed for cancellations, with August and July experiencing the highest cancellation rates, while November and January had the lowest cancellation rates.
Top 10 Countries with Reservation Cancellations:

Portugal (PRT) emerged as the top country with the highest number of reservation cancellations, accounting for 48.59% of all cancellations in the dataset. The United Kingdom (GBR) and the United States (USA) were the second and third countries with the highest cancellations, representing 10.99% and 9.58%, respectively.
Conclusion:
This data analysis provides valuable insights into hotel booking trends, cancellations, and ADR variations. The findings suggest that the City Hotel faces a higher cancellation rate, which may warrant further investigation into the factors contributing to the trend. Additionally, the analysis of ADR highlights the impact of seasonal pricing on reservation patterns and cancellations. The hotel management can use these insights to optimize pricing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:

The City Hotel should explore strategies to reduce the cancellation rate, such as offering flexible booking options or personalized offers to encourage guests to retain their reservations.
During peak ADR months, the hotels can implement stricter cancellation policies or offer non-refundable booking options to minimize revenue losses due to cancellations.
